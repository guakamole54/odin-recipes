    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sirloin tips, cubed</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell’s)</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package beef with onion soup mix</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages egg noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute beef sirloin tips with onion in the hot skillet until beef
            is browned,
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir cream of mushroom soup, milk, red wine, and beef with onion soup mix together in a bowl, pour into the
            skillet, and
            stir to coat beef in the soup mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet,
            and cook
            until the beef tips are tender, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to lowest setting and continue cooking until the beef pulls apart easily with a fork, at least 4
            hours more.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally until
            cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Ladle beef tips mixture over egg noodles.</li>
